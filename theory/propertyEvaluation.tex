Property specification is provided in the material model section of the input file. 
Unity Lewis number assumptions for diffusive flux coeffficients for mass fraction and enthalpy are assumed.

\subsubsection{Density}
At present, property evaluation for density is given by constant, single mixture fraction-based, simple tables,
or ideal gas. For ideal gas, we support a non-isothermal, non-uniform and even an accoustically compressible form.

\subsubsection{Viscosity}
Property evaluation for viscosity is given by constant, single mixture fraction-based, simple tables
or Sutherland's three coefficient as a function of temperature. When mixtures are used, either by reference or 
species transport, only a mass fraction-weighed approach is used.

\subsubsection{Specific Heat}
Property evaluation for specific heat is either constant of two-band standard NASA polynomials.

\subsubsection{Lame Properties}
Lame constants are either of type constant or for use in mesh motion/smoothing geometric wherebye
the values are inversely proportional to the dual volume.
